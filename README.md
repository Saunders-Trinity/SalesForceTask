## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I dont have much experiecne with javascript so I had to use stackoverflow to debugg my audio issues within my js file.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
My main challenge during this submission was learning the fundamentals of webdevlopment, especially using js,css and html together to create a product. I overcame this by also watching a quick crash course on webdev on youtube to understand how the 3 languages work together to make interactive websites. I also found that stack-overflow is useful for debugging and answering conceptual questions about how things in html look while using headers and dividers.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
My main question of web devolment is how can it be used to make better/more custom websites that look more highlevel.For example, there are things like wix and other website companies that make sites, so how could we as software engineers make our custom websites more robust.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If i had a few more hours to work on this, I would probably have more functionality to the game.Like in the processing workspace, there are full screen animations that I would make.So after a win, I would have the screen shower in confetti and if it was a lose, make the screen rain down L's.
